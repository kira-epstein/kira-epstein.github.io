		<p> I aspire to work in social media marketing and PR, I will incorporate visuals that encapsulate my audience and showcase my work through previous media campaigns, digital analytics, and various case studies to demonstrate a professional portfolio that is featuring all my projects. I aim to facilitate an interactive experience that is engaging and personable, while encouraging viewers to foster relationships and build connections as well. </p>

It will function as a professional portfolio showcasing my personal and professional projects, case studies, and some hobbies of mine. My website will be designed to exemplify eye-catching content as well as offer an engaging experience. Through this content, my website will capture an in-depth skillset of key elements within both marketing and PR that I demonstrate. My website will be personable, highlighting both my passion for marketing and PR, as well as awareness-driven campaigns. I am creating this website to highlight my personal branding and leadership, innovative digital and social media marketing resources, PR and communicative outlets, as well as a community engagement aspect that is focused on community impact and advocacy campaigns.
