			<p>Hi there! My name is Kira Epstein, a Boston native and senior at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wisc.edu/"> The University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>, majoring in Communication Sciences and Rhetorical Studies with a certificate in Digital Studies. I'm passionate about developing new skills and making a societal impact. My strengths lie in interpersonal and written communication, problem-solving, attention to detail, and collaboration. I'm actively involved in the Women's Network organization, where I enhance my business and leadership skills while supporting and connecting with fellow women on campus. As a visual learner with a creative mindset, I bring unique perspectives and produce creative campaign outputs, cutting-edge marketing solutions, and transformative PR strategies. I aim to pursue a career in the marketing and PR industry, as I look forward to contributing my skills to Chicagoâ€™s professional landscape.</p>
